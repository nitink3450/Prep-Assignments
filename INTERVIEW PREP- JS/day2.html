Q.6.What are closures?
-A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
-a closure is the function having access to the parent scope,even after the parent function is closed.
-example:
                function outer(){
                    let a=10;
                    function inner(){
                        console.log(a);
                    }
                    inner()
                }
                outer();

- in above example inner function is accessing to the value of a variable of the outer function 

Q.7.Give an example of the closures?
-example:
                function OuterFunction(name) {
                    var outerVariable = 100;
                function InnerFunction(message) {
                    console.log(outerVariable);//100
                    console.log(name);//nitin
                    console.log(message);//welcome
                }
                return InnerFunction;
                }
                var innerFunc=OuterFunction('nitin');
                innerFunc('welcome');

-As per the above code, InnerFunction() has access to the variables in the OuterFunction()
  scope even after the outer function has returned.

Q.8.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods?

    1)Call: The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided one by one
    -example:
            var car1 = { name: "audi", color: "white" };
            var car2 = { name: "benz", color: "black" };

            function model(message1, message2) {
            console.log(message1 + " " + this.name + " " + message2 + ", " +this.color );
            }

            model.call(car1, "my", "is"); // my audi is white
            model.call(car2, "my", "is"); // my benz is black

    2)Apply: Invokes the function with a given this value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array
    //by using apply we can pass the array to a function as an argument
    -example:
            var car1 = { name: "audi", color: "white" };
            var car2 = { name: "benz", color: "black" };

            function model(message1, message2) {
            console.log(message1 + " " + this.name + " " + message2 + ", " +this.color );
            }

            model.apply(car1,["my","is"]); // my audi is white
            model.apply(car2,["my","is"]); // my benz is black

    3)bind: returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments.and this new function we can call it anytime and anywhere
    -example:
            var car1 = { name: "audi", color: "white" };
            var car2 = { name: "benz", color: "black" };

            function model(message1, message2) {
            console.log(message1 + " " + this.name + " " + message2 + ", " +this.color );
            }

            let newModel= model.bind(car1);
            let newMode2= mode2.bind(car2);

            newModel("my","is");//my audi is white
            newMode2("my","is");//my benz is black

Q.9.What is the creation phase and execution phase?
 -Global execution context it is the first execution context that is created by js engine
  before any code is executed.(when the file first load in the browser)
-it has 2 phases:
    1)Creation phase:
        -this phase allows us to allocate memmory to all the variables but real value will not be assigned,
         only value is assigned as 'undefined'
         -example:
          var a = undefined;
    2)Execution phase:
        -In this phase variables will get assigned to there real values and 
         the function will get executed when some one calls it. 
         -example:
          var a = 9;

Q.10.What are objects in javascripts?
-In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
-Each key-value pair is called a property.
-The key of a property can be a string And the value of a property can be any value.
 e.g., a string, a number, an array, and even a function.
-JavaScript provides you with many ways to create an object.The most commonly used one is to use the object literal notation.
-The following example creates an empty object using the object literal notation:
   let empty = {};
-To create an object with properties, you use the key:value within the curly braces.
-For example, the following creates a new person object:
                let person = {
                    firstName: 'Nitin',
                    lastName: 'Kanhurkar'
                };
 -objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
 -These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods
 
Q.11.What are function constructors?
-The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class.
- If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used.
- The example usage of constructor would be as below,
                class Employee {
                constructor() {
                    this.name = "John";
                }
                }
                var employeeObject = new Employee();
                console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
-A constructor is a function that creates an instance of a class which is typically called an “object”.
-In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when you declare an object using the new keyword.
-The purpose of a constructor is to create an object and set values if there are any object properties present.

Q.12.Explain prototypes?
-A prototype is a blueprint of an object.
-Prototype allows us to use properties and methods on an object even if the properties and methods do not exist on the current object.
-prototype Object will be created inside the object which refers to the prototype constructor
-example:
                const parentObject={
                    name:"maharaj",
                    age:50,
                }
                var childObject=Object.create(parentObject)
                console.log(parentObject.name);//maharaj
                console.log(childObect.name);//maharaj

Q.13.What is prototype chaining?
-Prototypes are the means of inheritance in JavaScript.
-The prototype of an object would also have a prototype object.
-This continues until we reach the top level when there is no prototype object.
-This is called prototype chaining or prototype chain in JavaScript.
-When we try to access any property of an object it is first checked in the own property of the object.
-If the property does not exist in the own property then the prototype object is scanned for that property.
-This continues until we get the property we are accessing or we reach at to the end of prototype chain giving undefined.
-example-
                function Person() {
                    this.name = 'John'
                }

                // adding property 
                Person.prototype.name = 'Peter';
                Person.prototype.age = 23

                const person1 = new Person();

                console.log(person1.name); // John
                console.log(person1.age); // 23

Q.14.Give an examples of inheritance using function constructor?
-In JavaScript, a prototype can be used to add properties and methods to a constructor function.
-And objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
-example:
                // constructor function
                function Person () {
                    this.name = 'John',
                    this.age = 23
                }

                // creating objects
                const person1 = new Person();
                const person2 = new Person();

                // adding property to constructor function
                Person.prototype.gender = 'male';

                // prototype value of Person
                console.log(Person.prototype);//{ gender: "male" }

                // inheriting the property from prototype
                console.log(person1.gender);//male
                console.log(person2.gender);//male

Q.15.What are callbacks?
-Callbacks is the function which is passed as an argument to the another function.
-This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an actions.
-example:
            function callbackFunction(name) {
            console.log("Hello " + name);
            }
            function outerFunction(callback) {
            let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
            callback(name);
            }
            outerFunction(callbackFunction);

Q.16.What is the use of setTimeout?
-It is method used to call a function after specified number of time in milliseconds.
-example-
            setTimeout(function(){
                console.log('morning');//output will print after 2 sec
            },2000)

Q.17.What is the event loop and call stack?
-if there is a synchronous code it will run into the call stack but if there is asynchronous code(setTimeout) the it will detected by browser and it will run in web apis.
-then if asynchronous code will complete execution then it goes into callqueue then event loops comes in and
-If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the callback queue to the call stack.
-If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen
-example:
            function my(){
                let a='hii';
                let b='bye';
                console.log(a);//first print//synch
                setTimeout(function(){
                    console.log(b);//third print//asynchronous
                },2000);
            }
            my()
            console.log('nk');//second prints//synch
