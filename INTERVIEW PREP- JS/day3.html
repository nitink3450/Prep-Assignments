Q.18. What are promises and why do we need them?

-Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
-They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code. 

-Benefits of Promises: 
1.Improves Code Readability
2.Better handling of asynchronous operations
3.Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
4.Better Error Handling

-A Promise has four states: 
1.fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
2.rejected: Action related to the promise failed
3.pending: Promise is still pending i.e. not fulfilled or rejected yet
-A promise can be created using Promise constructor.

Syntax
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
     //do something
});

eg:
const promise = new Promise(
  (resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("I'm a Promise!");
    }, 5000);
  },
  (reject) => {}
);

promise.then((value) => console.log(value));

Q.19. What is the purpose of async/await keywords?
-It simply allows us to write promises based code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread.
-It operates asynchronously via the event-loop. Async functions will always return a value.
eg: 
const getData = async() => {
    var data = "Hello World";
    return data;
}
getData().then(data => console.log(data));//Hello World

#Await: Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the async block only.
- It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result. It only makes the async block wait.
eg
const getData = async() => {
    var y = await "Hello World";
    console.log(y);//1
}
console.log(1);//2
getData();
console.log(2);//Hello World

Q.20. What is hosting?
-hoisting allows us  to use functions and variables before they're declared.
-Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution.
-It allows us to call functions before even writing them in our code. 
-JavaScript only hoists declarations, not the initializations.
 eg:
function cHoist(){
	a = 10;
	let b = 50;
}
Hoist();

console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // ReferenceError : b is not defined

Q.21. What is the DOM?

-The document object represents the whole html document.
-When html document is loaded in the browser, it becomes a document object.
-It is the root element that represents the html document. It has properties and methods. 
-By the help of document object, we can add dynamic content to our web page.

5. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN:
-The undefined property indicates that the variable has not been assigned a value or not declared at all. 
-The NaN property represents a “Not-a-Number” value. The NaN property indicates that a value is not a legitimate number. 
-not defined: In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that JavaScript will throw when someone accesses the variable which is not inside the memory heap.

Q.22. How many operators do we have in JS ?
-An operator is used for manipulating a certain value or operand. 
-Operators are used to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.
1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Comparison Operators
3.Bitwise Operators
4.Logical Operators
5.Assignment Operators

Q.23. What are pure functions?
-A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.
-It does not depend on any state or data change during a program’s execution.it only depends on its input arguments.

eg:
function calculate( Price ) {
    return Price * 0.05;
}

Q.24. What is callback hell?
-Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure.
-Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code

Q.25. What is promise chaining?
-Promise chaining allows us to control the flow of JavaScript asynchronous operations.
-By using Promise chaining, we can use the returned value of a Promise as the input to another asynchronous operation.

 10. What are arrow functions?
 -Arrow functions are anonymous functions (the functions without a name and not bound with an identifier).
 -They don't return any value and can declare without the function keyword. 
 -Arrow functions cannot be used as the constructors. 
 -The context within the arrow functions is lexically or statically defined. They are also called as Lambda Functions
 syntax:
 const functionName = (arg1, arg2, ?..) => {  
    //body of the function  
} 

Q.26.Give an example of async/await?
-async: 
const getData = async() => {
    var data = "Hello Eberyone";
    return data;
}
getData().then(data => console.log(data));//Hello Everyone
-await:
eg
const getData = async() => {
    var y = await "Hello Everyone";
    console.log(y);//1
}
console.log(1);//2
getData();
console.log(2);//Hello World
