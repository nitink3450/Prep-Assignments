Q.1. What is the difference between == && ===?

-JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison.
-The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators 
 make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. 
-The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters,
   same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. 
   i.e, Having the same number value. There are two special cases in this,
    i. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
    ii. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==.
   i.e, null===undefined false but null==undefined  true
Some of the example which covers the above cases,

0 == false   // true
0 === false  // false
1 == "1"     // true
1 === "1"    // false
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory

Q.2.What is the spread Operator?

-Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into
  single arguments/elements.
-pass an array of numbers as a individual function arguments.

let array1 = ['h', 'e', 'y'];
let array2 = [...array1];
console.log(array2);
Output:[ 'h', 'e', 'y' ]

Q.3.What is the difference between var let and const?

-In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and const.
-var keyword is oldest keyword and let and const are introduced in es6.

1.var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
2.var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated 
  but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
3.They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are 
  initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
4.While var and let can be declared without being initialized,
  const must be initialized during declaration.

Q.4.What is execution context?

-The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation
 and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.
-The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running,
 and everything that aids in its execution.
-During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser,
 the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated,
 and the code gets executed.
-There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
            1.Global Execution Context (GEC)
            2.Function Execution Context (FEC)

Q.5.What is meant by first class functions?

-A Programming Language is said to have first class function when function in that language
 are treated like any other variable 
        1.We can assign a function to an variable 
        2.we can pass a function as an argument 
        3. Function can be returned by another function

      const game = () =>console.log('first class function');
      document.addEventListner('click',game);
