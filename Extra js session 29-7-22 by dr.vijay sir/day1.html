<h1>Q.1.What is Javascript?</h1>
-Javascript is a combination of both compiler and interpreter and it works on the concept of JIT (Just in time compilation).<br>
-In this the whole code gets compiled in one single shot and then directly it goes for execution , no file gets generated.<br>
-Javascript is a -
    1.Synchronous lanaguage means the complete code will be executed line by line<br>
    2.Single Threaded language means once the error occurs then the execution will stop at that line itself.<br>
    3.Dynamic Programming Language means when you are creating a variable and assigning it some value then this value type can be changed throughout the whole code execution which is not applicable in other programming languages.<br>

<h1>Q.2.what is the javascript run time environment?</h1>
-A runtime environment is where your program will be executed.<br>
-It determines what global objects your program can access and it can also impact how it runs.<br>
-it has two JavaScript runtime environments:<br>
    1.the runtime environment of a browser (like Chrome, or Firefox)<br>
    2.the Node runtime environment<br>

<h1>Q.3. what is execution context?</h1>
-The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation
 and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.<br>
-The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running,
 and everything that aids in its execution.<br>
-During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser,
 the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated,
 and the code gets executed.<br>
-There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:<br>
            1.Global Execution Context (GEC)<br>
            2.Function Execution Context (FEC)<br>

<h1>Q.4.what is javascript Engine?</h1>
-JS engine is a program which gets used to execute the JS code.v
-All the browsers have their own JS engine. But out of all the most famous one is V8 engine provided by Google chrome.<br>
-Internet Explorer has Chakra Mozilla Firefox has Spider Monkey<br>
-Every code that has to be executed firstly gets converted into machine level language which is a combination of 0 and 1.v
-This code is understandable by machine and then it finally gets executed.<br>
Now this complete process is known as compilation and it can be done by either compiler or interpreter.<br>
-In case of compiler the complete code gets converted into machine level in a single shot and it creates a file which finally gets used in execution.<br>
-whereas in case of interpreter the code gets converted into machine level line by line and it does not create any file.<br>

<h1>Q.5.flow of data in engine?</h1>
-there are 4 levels in engine to flow our data in browser:
<ol type="1">
    <li>PARSER </li>
    <li>AST(Abstract Syntax Tree)</li>
    <li>COMPILER</li>
    <li>EXECUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>
    -When we run our js code in browser(chrome) runtime environment means in js engine(v8 engine) <br>
    -first it will pass through a parser,parser checks that if our code syntax,if any syntax error found it will throw an error to browser and returns our code back.<br>
    -if syntax is good then it will tranfered/passed to AST(Abstract Syntax Tree).<br>
    -AST it creates the tree structure like tokens of the source code of a computer program that conveys the structure of the source code. like variabledeclarations, identifires, literals etc. <br>
    -then our code is passed to the Compiler,compiler converts our whole code into the macchine level language.<br>
    -then it passed for the Execution process after execution output will display on the console or on webpage.<br>
    -Execution context allows the JavaScript engine to manage the complexity of interpreting and running our code.
